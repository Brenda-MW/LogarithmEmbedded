# Develop Embedded Logarithm with MATLAB and MATLAB Coder
A lightweight and efficient implementation of logarithmic functions is important for the embedded systems. Designed for performance and minimal resource usage, this library provides  base-2, base-10, and natural logarithm computations without relying on floating-point hardware.

# Features
1. Aim for low-power microcontrollers and real-time applications
2. Integer and fixed-point support
3. Reduced memory footprint
4. Portable and easy to integrate into C/C++ embedded projects
5. Ideal for developers working on signal processing, control systems, or any embedded application requiring fast and reliable logarithmic calculations.
